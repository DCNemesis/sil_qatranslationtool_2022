                Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

                One of the mechanisms that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter the lungs, called the ACE2 receptors, lives in the heart as well. When the virus enters the heart, it can cause clots, pulmonary embolism, or clots within the arteries of the heart causing a heart attack.
