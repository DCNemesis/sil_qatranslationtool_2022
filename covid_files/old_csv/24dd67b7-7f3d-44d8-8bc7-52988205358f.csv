"Many of John's friends were proudly telling John that they just got the covid19 vaccine. But John had some concerns about it. John comes from a church that opposes abortion, the killing of innocent, unborn babies. So John decided to ask his doctor for his thoughts on the vaccine."
"John, ""Doctor, is it true that the covid19 vaccine contains aborted baby tissue?""  Doctor, ""Pfizer, BioNTech, Spunik, AstraZeneca, Vaxart, and Moderna Vaccines were protein tested using the abortion-derived cell line HEK-293. Johnson & Johnson Vaccine has publicly admitted to using a cell line called PER.C6. "
"John: Are there other options for preventing or treating covid 19, other than the vaccine?  Doctor: Ivermectin: a multifaceted drug of Nobel prize-honoured distinction is very effective against COVID-19. The Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance provides more information about this here: https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/"
"John: ""Doctor, I  have heard that many people have allergic reactions to Polyethylene glycol (PEG).  Doctor: According to pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27804292, 72% of the general population are allergic to PEG. Their reaction may include anaphylactic symptoms including rashes, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and a decrease in blood pressure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people who have a known allergy to PEG should not get the Covid19 vaccine."
"John: ""Doctor, I am also concerned about graphene oxide, another toxin in the covid19 vaccine.  Doctor: ""Graphene oxide accumulated in the lungs can have devastating impacts. This poison is also known to cause thrombi, blood coagulation, ischemia, stroke, paraplegia, immobilization of the limbs, pericarditis, myocarditis, and sudden death.

"John: ""Doctor, I am also concerned about what I am hearing about the spike protein.""  Doctor: ""You should be concerned John. The inventor of the MRNA technology which is used in the covid19 vaccine has stated that the spike protein is very dangerous, it's cytotoxic ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du2wm5nhTXY&t=87s). Furthermore, the FDA advises that individuals allergic to any ingredient of this vaccine should NOT receive the vaccine (https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download#page=2) "
"John: ""So, doctor, it sounds like these vaccines may not be as safe as many people claim."" Doctor: ""According to Dr. Peter Mccullough, the vaccine manufacturing companies either skipped all the required testing or chose not to publish the results of their testing. These vaccines damage the ovaries and thousands of people have already died directly from the covid19 vaccine making it one of the most lethal medical products on the market today.  https://thelibertydaily.com/here-is-the-video-by-dr-peter-mccullough-that-is-changing-minds-about-the-vaccines/"
"Doctor: ""Also John, Steve Kirsch, the Executive Director of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, stated that “expert analysis” revealed that over 150,000 people have died in the U.S. following a COVID-19 injection.""  https://healthimpactnews.com/2021/study-governments-own-data-reveals-that-at-least-150000-probably-dead-in-u-s-following-covid-19-vaccines/"
"John, ""Doctor, I feel that abortions are morally wrong and I don't want to benefit from the abortion industry in any way. I also want to keep my body pure from potential poisons. Is there a way, I could get a religious exemption to the covid 19 shot?""  Doctor, ""You should ask your pastor about this."" "
"John met with Pastor Robert to ask about this.  John: ""Pastor Robert, I have concerns about the covid19 vaccine. I learned that all vaccines used aborted baby tissue in the testing and development of the vaccine and some vaccines actually have aborted baby tissue in the vaccine. I am also concerned about the poisons in the vaccine such as Polyethylene glycol (PEG), graphene oxide, and the spike protein.  Pastor Robert: ""I agree with you John. That is why no one in my family has taken the vaccine. I can prepare a letter like this one on the next page for you if you want."""
"I am writing to confirm the sincerely held religious beliefs of John regarding not participating in covid vaccines. As an ordained Pastor of First Baptist Church, I attest to John's objection to this practice of covid vaccines.  Some substances in the vaccine are possibly harmful to the human body and the Bible tells us that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and as such, should be kept pure. “Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?” (1 Cor 6:19)  Therefore, I attest that John has the lawfully protected right to seek a religious exemption from activities that are offensive to his sincerely held religious beliefs. I would accept a phone call from your institution to discuss this further Biblically, morally, ethically, spiritually, and constitutionally.  Sincerely Pastor Robert First Baptist Church"
