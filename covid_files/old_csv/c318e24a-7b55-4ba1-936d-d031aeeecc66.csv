"Sunil is very depressed and deeply thinking  about Coronavirus.  One day he is meeting his friend Ramu.  Ramu: Hello Sunil, How are you, Are you okay ,,, you are looking sad today."
"Sunil: Hello Ramu, what is happending in this world? Everywhere Coronavirus. We can’t travel anywhere, Lots of people dying in India and all over the world. I am afraid that this Coronavirus may come to our village too. It might infect me and my family. What if my family members die because of this? Why is this happening? Where is God in this situation? Did God cause this? Is it God's punishment?  Ramu: Let me answer your questions, with the  story of Job,"
"Job was the wealthiest, most blessed man, maybe in the whole world. He loves God very much and was faithful to follow His commands. At some point, Satan actually approaches God himself and basically asks God to put Job to the test. God was speaking well of Job and how faithful Job was to him. Satan boasted that the only reason Job was faithful to God was because God had given him everything he could ever want: family, wealth, land etc. So God actually allows Satan to take all those things away from Job in order to see if Job would still be faithful to God. So Job loses everything including his family and even becomes infected with leprosy; he is in terrible agony both physically and emotionally. Despite all this Job remains faithful to God and Bible says in all his difficulties he didint sin.  (Job 1:13-22)   From the story of Job, Sunil, what do we learn is the reason for his suffering? Is it because of Job’s Sin? "
"No, Ramu, it was not the result of Job’s sin.  It was because of Satan that  God allowed Job to go through that for a reason.   Ramu:   “That’s a good answer”. "
"Ramu:  Let us open our Bible to Luke 13:1-9 1About this time Jesus was informed that Pilate had murdered some people from Galilee as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple. 2 “Do you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee?” Jesus asked. “Is that why they suffered? 3 Not at all! And you will perish, too, unless you repent of your sins and turn to God. 4 And what about the eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Were they the worst sinners in Jerusalem? 5 No, and I tell you again that unless you repent, you will perish, too.”  6 Then Jesus told this story: “A man planted a fig tree in his garden and came again and again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed. 7 Finally, he said to his gardener, ‘I’ve waited three years, and there hasn’t been a single fig! Cut it down. It’s just taking up space in the garden.’ 8 “The gardener answered, ‘Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year, and I’ll give it special attention and plenty of fertilizer. 9 If we get figs next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down.’” Sunil, What answer did Jesus give to  his disciples for these two unfortunate incidents in which people died?"
"Sunil:  Jesus clearly says that, in the two incidents, they did not die because of their sins. Nor they were the worst sinners in the city of Jerusalem.  Ramu: Yes, We understand from Bible that suffering and sickness are not what God has intended for his creation. The mission of God is to redeem and restore the whole of creation and the church. God wants each one of us repent from our sins and come back to God. He wants each one us to be a blessings to the world.  God wants Christians to see those suffering from calamities and death with love and compassion, not with judgmental eyes."
Ramu:  Let’s look at few more Bible verses Mark 12: 31 ..... ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these.” John 15:13 There is no greater love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  Jeus is calling us to demonstrate our love to the neighbors who live in our villages and near and far.We need to pray regularly for Coronavirus situation in India. In this time of need we need to help poor and needy. Especially who are going through lots of hardships. As a church we need to take collective effort to help people who are suffering in this season.  
"Sunil: Does that mean I should care for others during the COVID-19 crisis and ignore my own safety and health? Ramu: Not at all, we need to care for ourselves and our family. We should take care of our health. We nee to wear mask, keep physical distance and wash our hands with soap frequently. Also as Christians we should look for opportunities to help the poor and needy and others. We shouldn't be only caring for ourselves. Thus we can be light and salt to others as God’s witnesses."
"Sunil: Ramu, what steps do I need to take when I feel sad and depressed during this Coronavirus time? Ramu: Take care of your body by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising.  Reestablish routines, especially with children, to reduce the feeling of chaos.  Spend time with positive people, even if you feel like being alone.  Read the Bible and meditate. Sing or listen to music to relax. Laugh when you can; cry when you need to. Practice breathing deeply from the diaphragm and consciously relax your body.  Ask for help if you need it and accept help that is offered. Avoid making  major decisions too quickly when you are under stress or are emotionally upset. Laugh when you can; cry when you need to.  Practice breathing deeply from the diaphragm and consciously relax your body.  Ask for help if you need it and accept help that is offered.  "
Sunil:  is the outbreak of COVID-19 a ‘natural disaster’ Or Is it a disaster of our own making? 
"Ramu: When Adam and Eve sinned they brought death and evil into the world, which means everyone will experience the negative effects of that. Viruses and other Pandemics plaguing and killing those who inhabit the earth are an example of this sad reality."
"Ramu: Sunil, When Adam and Eve sinned they brought death and evil into the world, which means everyone will experience the negative effects of their sin. Human beings became selfish and they became greedy."
"Ramu:  We live in a broken world. This brokenness is evident whenever there is injustice, poverty, corruption, greed, violence and environment damage. As hard as it is to hear, the outbreak of Covid-19 is not a ‘natural disaster’. Rather it is a disaster of our own making. We as human abused and excessively used the forest and brought the wild animals to city. The virus from animals are transmitted to human when they come to close these Forest animals."
"Sunil: Ramu, Widespread conflicts and war in the world, a plague of locusts spreading across Africa, even in India, flooding around the world and COVID-19 pandemic. Surely these are the last signs of the end times, are they not?"
"Ramu: Sunil, If there’s one thing that we can say for certain, Jesus himself did not know when the end times would be. Matthew 24:36 “However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.” The signs which are fortold in the people are happending, but we cant claim Jesus is going come to day or tomorrow, but we need t get prepared for his coming."
"Sunil: That’s right, who are we to try and say when the end will come now? Thanks Ramu for explaining it so well. Now I understand my responsibility as a Christian better. Let’s regularly meet together, share and pray for the COVID-19 situation. Thanks for taking time to explain me everything."
