What are vaccines? Why should I get vaccinated?
Vaccines contain antigen. Antigen is a part of a pathogen. Pathogen are germs that cause disease.  
Antigen cause my body to produce antibodies. Antibodies defend my immune system and fight off future pathogen.  
Being vaccinated won't give me the disease.
Being vaccinated will teach my body to build antibodies to protect me against future disease.
