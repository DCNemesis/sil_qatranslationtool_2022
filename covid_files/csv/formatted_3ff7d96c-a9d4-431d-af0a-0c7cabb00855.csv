"","                                                                Instructionsfor facilitators 1. Make sure to listen to group members’ concerns and answer their questions. 2. Emphasize that members can do a lot to keep themselves and others safe. For example, introduce the concept of social distancing, and focus on good health behaviours, such as covering coughs and sneezes with the elbow and washing hands. 3. Encourage members to confront and prevent stigma. Discuss the reactions they may experience around discrimination, and explain that these are normal reactions in emergency situations. Encourage them to express and communicate their feelings, but also explain that fear and stigma make a difficult situation worse. Words matter, and using language that perpetuates existing stereotypes can drive people away from taking the actions they need to protect themselves.  4. Dicuss after reading the booklet: Read some do’s and don’ts for how to talk about the coronavirus. 5. Remind members that they can share healthy behaviours with their families. Be a leader in keeping themsleves, their family, their village and their community healthy. ",,

"","FACTS ABOUT COVID-19  (Please read this before the group discussion, use these questions to check the group unrstood the content) 1. What is COVID-19?  COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’ The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.                            2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. 3. How does COVID-19 spread?  The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.      4. Who is most at risk?    Older people, and people with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms.  As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical conditions. 5. What is the treatment for COVID-19?  There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.               6. How can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down or prevented? As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical to slow the spread of illnesses. Public health measures are everyday preventive actions that include: ✓ staying home when sick; ✓ covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing.

Make sure to listen to group members’ concerns and answer their questions. 2. Emphasize that members can do a lot to keep themselves and others safe. For example, introduce the concept of social distancing, and focus on good health behaviours, such as covering coughs and sneezes with the elbow and washing hands. 3. Encourage members to confront and prevent stigma. Discuss the reactions they may experience around discrimination, and explain that these are normal reactions in emergency situations. Encourage them to express and communicate their feelings, but also explain that fear and stigma make a difficult situation worse. Words matter, and using language that perpetuates existing stereotypes can drive people away from taking the actions they need to protect themselves.  4. Dicuss after reading the booklet: Read some do’s and don’ts for how to talk about the coronavirus. 5. Remind members that they can share healthy behaviours with their families. Be a leader in keeping themsleves, their family, their village and their community healthy.      A pandemic disease caused by Corona virus started in China and spread to other countrires from there.  It came to India from these infected people who came to India from other countires, later they brought this disease unknowingly and spread it to others. Thus, Corona spread rapidly through infected people in different parts of India.Government of India is taking all necessary steps to face the challenge and threat posed by the growing pandemic of COVID-19 the Corona Virus with active support of the people of India. More than a lakh died around the world  due to COVID-19. But, If we are careful and keep hygienic habits, we can stay away from this disease and save others from infection. What do we need to do to protect ourselves from COVID-19?  Wash your hands 8 ways with soap as shown in the picture. After doing an outdoor job, wash your hands. If you visit people with a fever, you have to wash your hands or preferably take a bath before you enter your house. (Please do a demo of washing hands infront your group)  Avoid touching your face, mouth, nose and eyes since COVID-19 could, in fact, be spread through your unwsahed hands. Keep your nails short and trim them often.  If you cough or sneeze, cover your face with a handkerchief or cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands.  When you speak to people, keep 6 feet distance.   Don’t give a handshake to known or unknown people. Keep a distance and do namaskar.  Stay away from marketplaces where people gather in large numbers or any other places people gather and keep your physical distance.   Don’t spit in the common places. Don’t eat Pan and other tobacco items and then spit everywhere.   If you see a person with high fever or shaking chills, headache, coughing and diarrhea, keep your distance. Inform ASHA DIDI or inform the block medical hospital.  People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. If your area is infected with COVID-19, please make Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas through soap or bleech (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, keyboards, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)  If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces  If you go out of the house, make sure to wear a mask or tie a handkerchief to cover your face. Wash your mask and dry it every day. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.   Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases like COVID-19. So you should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs. Drink enough water. It is advisable to soak fruits and vegetables in warm water that has one or two teaspoons of salt for twenty minutes or soak them with a solution of vinegar and water for 20 minutes. If you are planning to go for labour work, look for government directives or ask people who know about the place whether it is safe for you to travel. But it is  better for you to stay in your village and do some work or business because many cities have gotten infected with the Corona virus, and many people are dying every day. FACTS ABOUT COVID-19  (Please read this before the group discussion, use these questions to check the group unrstood the content) 1. What is COVID-19?  COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’ The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.                            2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. 3. How does COVID-19 spread?  The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing). Individuals can also be infected from and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth). The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.      4. Who is most at risk?    Older people, and people with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms.  As this is a new virus, we are still learning about how it affects children. We know it is possible for people of any age to be infected with the virus, but so far there are relatively few cases of COVID-19 reported among children. This is a new virus and we need to learn more about how it affects children. The virus can be fatal in rare cases, so far mainly among older people with pre-existing medical conditions. 5. What is the treatment for COVID-19?  There is no currently available vaccine for COVID-19. However, many of the symptoms can be treated and getting early care from a healthcare provider can make the disease less dangerous. There are several clinical trials that are being conducted to evaluate potential therapeutics for COVID-19.               6. How can the spread of COVID-19 be slowed down or prevented? As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical to slow the spread of illnesses. Public health measures are everyday preventive actions that include: ✓ staying home when sick; ✓ covering mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of used tissue immediately; ✓ washing hands often with soap and water; and ✓ cleaning frequently touched surfaces and objects. As we learn more about COVID-19 public health officials may recommend additional actions. (Courtesy: https://www.unicef.org/india/)  ",,
