Introduction to this Guide
"• The COVID-19 virus is making many people sick. Most people can recover at home. When someone starts feeling short of breath, or when they do not begin to feel better after a week, it is best to take them to a Doctor or health clinic.  • But sometimes that is not possible. There are times when even very sick people must be cared for at home. This can be frightening for both the sick person and for those who are taking care of them.  • This book tells how to give home-based care while also protecting others in the household and community who are not sick. COVID-19 is a serious illness, but there are ways to help the sick person be more comfortable, and most survive the illness.  • COVID-19 is a serious disease, and is best cared for in the hospital. But many people who get very sick don't have a doctor or hospital to help. This book gives guidance on how to care for people at home in ways that can make them more comfortable while they are sick, and help many of them recover from the illness.  • Your country/government will have guidelines that should be followed."
Basic Information about COVID-19
The main points for avoiding COVID-19 are also the main points for Home-based Care.
Keep 2 meters distance between people.
Wear a mask when in a shared space.
Wash hands frequently and don’t touch your face or mask
"Early Signs that someone has COVID-19: • Fever • Cough • Sore Throat • Loss of taste/smell • General body pain, general bad feeling • Diarrhea • Runny or stuffy nose  People who are sick with the virus may not show all the signs."
"If someone has any of these signs, they should be tested, if possible. It is important to tell other people who they have been close to about their illness so those people can also watch for signs of illness. Those people should also stay away from other people for fourteen days to avoid spreading the illness."
"People are most contagious when they first feel they are getting sick. Many people have very mild symptoms, but they can still spread the illness to other people, who may get very sick."
Home Care for Well People
"If possible, one healthy person in the family should be the caregiver for those who are ill. The carer needs to take care of herself/himself too: • wear a mask • wash hands with soap after every contact • take time to rest and eat, • spend as little time with the sick person/people as possible.  Everyone else in the household should stay away from the sick person, wash their hands often, and avoid touching their faces. They should wear masks when they are in any area where the sick person goes."
"Other people from outside can bring food and leave it outside the door, and can come to encourage from a distance, but they should not come into the house. "
"Children in the family should not play with other children.  If Health workers visit, they should wear a coat, face and eye coverings."
Home Care for the Sick Person or People
"The sick person needs to be in a separate room, or, if that is not possible, as far away from the others as possible -- at least two meters.  If the weather allows, they can be cared for outside, or separate the area where the sick people stay with sheets or furniture.  Drawing a two meter line to remind people to stay away can be helpful."
"If there is more than one ill person, they can all stay in the same area, and do not have to stay far apart."
Face masks should be washed daily with soap and water and dried in the sun if possible. 
Home Care for Someone with Mild Sickness
"The sick person or people should stay in one area and not move around to avoid spreading the sickness to other people in the house. The sick person should wear a mask any time someone who is not sick is near them.  If possible, open a door or window to the outside of the house to keep air moving.  They are allowed to eat all foods. They need to drink a lot of fluids, about 2 liters each day if the sick person is an adult. Tea, water, fruits, and soup are all helpful. Hot drinks and hot water may help them to feel better.  They should have their own dishes and not share them. The person washing the dishes should be careful to wash his or her hands afterwards. Any trash should be kept in a bag, then tied up and burned.  Paracetamol, Aspirin (ASA, Acetyl Salicylic Acid) and Ibuprofen are medications that can help with fever and pain. It is important to follow the directions of a health worker to give the correct amount of medicine."
"Whenever the person uses the toilet or bathroom, all surfaces should be wiped with disinfectant, especially door handles, water taps. Wash surfaces and wash cleaning cloths often."
Home Care for the Very Sick Person or People
"Most people recover from the illness after a few days. They need to stay away from other people for at least 14 days after they first feel sick. After that, they can be with other people if they have been without a fever for 24 hours.  But some people get very ill with COVID-19.  Signs of more severe sickness: ●      Difficulty breathing ●      High fever ●      If they are not behaving or thinking normally. ●      If the person starts to get well, and then gets         worse again.  If someone has these signs, they should be taken to a health care facility if possible. "
If you must care for a very ill person at home here are some ways to help:
"• Get help from a Community Health Worker if possible.  • Remember to care for yourself: wear a mask when near the sick person, and take time to eat and rest.  • Many sick people get very short of breath, and feel afraid. Stay with the person if possible. It will make the sick person more afraid if you show that you are upset. Talk calmly to them, and comfort them by saying that the feeling of panic will get better.   • No visitors should come near the patient because they might get sick and spread the illness."
"Keep the patient in a well-ventilated room, near a window or where they can feel air blowing on them. Fresh air will help them breathe better. They can be outside too, if they won’t be in contact with other people."
"Help them change positions regularly. When they are awake, help them lie on their stomach for a while if they can. This helps their lungs work better."
"One Way to Help: a Bubble Bottle  Make a bubble bottle and help them use it 5 to 7 times per day. To make a bubble bottle you will need:  - A simple bottle (empty soda bottle etc.) - A long straw - Clean, non-sparkling water  Fill the bottle with clean water.  Put the straw in the bottle until it is about 5 cm deep in the water.  It may be helpful to attach the straw to the bottle with some tape or string, but this is not necessary."
"Instruct the patient to take a deep breath, then put the straw in his/her mouth and exhale as long as possible through the straw, blowing bubbles in the water of the bottle.  The patient should do this about 5 to 10 times in a row, about 5-7 times a day."
Home Care as a Person Gets Better
"For people who have been ill, remind them it may take a long time to regain strength. Encourage them to eat and exercise as much as they can, even if it seems like very little.  After 14 days, if they have not had a fever for at least 24 hours, if it safe for them to be with other people and will not spread the sickness  Recovery can take a long time: help them notice small  signs that they are getting better."
Key Points
"• Home care is possible.  • Home care involves the whole family.  • Community Health Workers and other people in the community can provide needed support and encouragement even though they may not be able to give direct care.  • When people get very sick with COVID-19, they are best cared for in the hospital. When that is not possible, the activities described in this book can make them more comfortable while they are sick, and can help many of them recover. "
