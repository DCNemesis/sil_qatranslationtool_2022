"""Amen hibeh bagei ajeh, hik buleh hitulog pebehenti virus ajeh dari kijekjog ju numom nu numom.""","""Doing these things will help to stop the virus from spreading from person to person”."
"Nuarik, Anita kirasa pek sihat iberog. Ihat pehot ikui, beket iberog, ru kek ya mula kikehol. Kek juga kiperasan kek pek dapat kirasa ru kikerngoi caknak de kicak. Anita kisedar kek ya kikena nyaknik virus Covid-19.","One day, Anita doesn’t feel well. She has a bad headache, a fever, and has begun to cough. Also, she notices that she cannot taste or smell her food. Anita realizes that she has Covid-19. "

He brings her food and takes away the empty dishes. He keeps her dishes separate and only Anita uses them."
David selalu kilog tuntop moh ru empag jap kali kimuj nu kateh bilek de bigei ya ikenah ajeh. Kek juga selalu kisuj iteg jap kali kibeh ma-ma ihal ha ikenah ajeh. Anita juga kilog tuntop moh ru empag jap kali igensir kimuj nu kateh ibilek.,David always wears a mask whenever he goes into her room. He also washes his hands every time he does anything for her.

"Amen ya sudah, kek selalu kisuj jap pemukaan ya sabon sebelom kijog nu ibilek.","When she is done, she wipes down the bathroom with a disinfectant solution before going back to her room."
"Telas memerip arik ju kenjeh, Marcos, kenon Anita de iumor 8 tahot ya mula kirasa nyik juga. Amek Anita de kigei sama ru enai pen ya mula kirasa beket iberog.

Enai naipanei, mimang ihat penteng dea pringak Anita ru David hat naigei padeg taleh.", Some neighbors bring groceries and fever medicines so that the family does not spread the disease by going to the shops themselves. They understand that even people who do not feel sick might have the virus and can spread the illness. They know it is important that Anita and David's whole family stays at home.
"David kiurok nu ijiran-jiran, ""Aguk terbuk rek nu pringak enj de nyik adeh! Enj ngnyek engkek pen doh engkenyik juga. Tapi, bedoaleh ha jik ru suegleh jik ju luar deg taleh.""","David says to the neighbors, “Do not come close to our sick family members! We do not want you to get sick, too.

Kek juga pen turot kibehati-hati ju care kilog tuntop moh ru empag.","The pastor comes every couple of days to pray for the sick, and encourage them by reading the Scriptures aloud from across the fence.

Ku mase pek lalu naiha-cak jeoi, kek kiog enai caknak bagei ha sup. Ikekenon menaleh naitulog masak sup ajeh. ","The Community Health Worker, Maria, has taught David how to care for his sick family. He knows to give them fever medicine when they need it.  When they cannot eat much, he feeds them simple hot broth and soup. His daughters help by cooking the broth."
"Ijak, Flora, kinyik terok lei pek lalu kicakcak.","His mother-in-law, Flora, gets so ill that she cannot eat anything."
"Jadi, David kicampor 8 sudu gula ru setengah sudu empoj ku kateh teu ru kiog Flora, ijak ajeh kingot. Kek selalu kipastikan ipringak de nyik ajeh naingot jeoi teu, sekurang-kurang 2 liter nuarik.","So, David  mixes 8 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a liter of clean water for Flora to drink. He tries to make sure that they all drink two liters of liquid per day."
"Telas memerip arik kinyik terok, Anita ya mula kirasa bor. Ikenon, Marcos, pek kinyik terok ru deras kibor.","After several days of being very sick, Anita begins to feel better. Her son, Marcos, does not get very sick and recovers very quickly."
"Flora, amek Anita, juga ya mula kirasa bor telas memerip arik, tapi telas ajeh kinyik gumaken terok nij. Ibengket berog gumaken terok ru ya mula susah kaha-belehem.  Anita kisengoh. Kek kiurok nu David, ""Hik mesti hien amek nu dokte!""  David kiberlag, ""Enj betol-betol ngbeharap hik buleh hibeh bagei ajeh. Tapi, pek mong bas kerana PKP. Maria, pekerjak Kesihatan Komuniti hik pen pek dapat kihol madeh!""","Flora, Anita’s mother, starts to feel better for a couple of days, too, but then she gets sicker again. Her fever goes up and she begins to have difficulty breathing.  Anita is scared for her mother. She says to David, “We need to take Mama to the Doctor!”  David replies, “I wish we could. But because of the lockdown there are no buses running. Even Maria, our Community Health Worker, can’t come!"""
"Syukur, Anita buleh kitalipon Maria ru kisemanj nasihat ha care kaha-jaga iamek.","Thankfully, Anita is able to call Maria on the phone to get some advice about how to take care of her mother."
"Maria kiurok, ""Ingat, engkek mesti kuarantin ru pek engkebegaul ru mai sekelileg dea pek engkeog nyaknik engkek kijekjog nu mai kilek. Mimang mong icare ha jaga amek hek hamapen pek dapat engkehol nu luar.""","Maria tells her, “Remember that all of you still need to quarantine from the rest of the community to keep from spreading the disease. There are ways you can help your mother even if you cannot go out.”"
"Kiurok nu Anita, ""Hek hunen dapat hajaga amek hek kerana lihek ya hakenak Covid-19 ru pek mungken buleh hakena nukali nij. Bilek amek hek hotleh mong aliran udare de bor ru kek hot selalu kingot teu, pek kira teu kusongka, tehka, atau sup."" Maria kirasa lega kerana bilek enai mong pintu nu luar deg, jadi buleh naibuka dea muj pinoi nu kateh deg.  David kibuka pintu ru kiletak jaring dea pinoi dapat kimuj, tapi kemet ru roi pek dapat. Amen pintu bitutop, David kipastikan tingkap lekat bibuka dea udare segar dapat kimuj nu kateh deg ru kitulog ijak kibelehem lebeh senang nij.","She says to Anita, “You can now care for your mother since you have already had Covid-19 and it is unlikely that you will get it again right away. Also, Flora’s room needs to be well-ventilated and she needs to keep drinking liquids"". Maria is glad to hear that the room has a door to the outside, which can be opened to let air inside.  David opens the door and puts a screen curtain up so that the air can come in but the flies stay outside. When the door is shut, David makes sure the window is open because the fresh air helps Flora to breathe more easily. "
Anita kitulog iamek ngot teu sekurang-kurang tiap nujam nukali.,Anita helps her mother take sips of water at least every hour.
"Anita kibelajar ju Maria, tiap jam iamek hot kitarek ilehem ajerek, ru kiperhol ilehem ajeh pelahat-lahat. Hal ajeh buleh kitulog iparu-paru kibekerja bor.  ","Anita learns from Maria to have her mother take some deep, slow breaths every hour. This helps Flora keep her lungs working properly."

Kek kicuba beh iamek dakdak kekkop kerana hal ajeh buleh kitulog iamek kibelehem dea iparu-paru kibekerja bor.,Anita also helps Flora change her position often. She tries to have Flora lie on her stomach whenever she can because that also helps Flora’s lungs.
Maria juga kiajar Anita care kilek de buleh kitulog paru-paru iamek ajeh. Icare. guna butol tenghol.,"Maria also teaches Anita another way to help Flora’s lungs, by making a bubble bottle."
"Mula-mula, Anita kiisi butol kusong ya teu, lebeh kurang 5 sentimiter iteninggi ru kiletak strow ku kateh butol ajeh.",First Anita fills a coke bottle with about 5 centimeters of water and puts a straw into the bottle.
"Telas ajeh, iamek kitehol nu kateh butol ajeh pelahat-lahat lei iteu hol jeoi udare. Kibeh hal ajeh memerip kali nuarik dea kitulog iparu-paru bekerjak bor.",Then Flora blows gently into the straw to make the water bubble. Doing this several times every couple of hours helps her lungs work better.
Anita kibesyukor ha neajar ju Maria. Iamek ya mula kirasa bor ru itenage ya kijekjog nij.,Anita is thankful for all of Maria's advice. Flora slowly begins to feel better and gets her strength back.
"Ipringak naikira merip iluniu sejak Anita, Marco, ru Flora mula nainyik. Telas ya 14 arik, naikot nij suhu berog enai. Telas 24 jam, pek mong numom pen ju enai ajeh de nyik. Jadi, enai ya buleh naihol ju kendeg. Enai ya pek akan naiog nyaknik enai kijekjog nu mai kilek.","The family keeps track of the days since Anita, Marco and Flora first got sick. Finally, after 14 days, they check their temperatures. None of them have had a fever for at least 24 hours, and they are able to go out of the house again.They will not spread the sickness anymore."

She wants to thank her for all she’s taught Anita and the rest of the community. David and Anita are glad to know that they took care of their family in the best possible ways even though they could not go and get medical help in person.  Many others in their community have Covid-19. Anita and David have learned so much that now they can help them and their families."
"Gerija enai selalu naipelagak mai ya bedoa ru selalu juga naien caknak ha mai de nyik. Enai juga naitulog danan mai kerana Covid-19, ru naiturot serta besedeh besama pringak ru komuniti ajeh.",Their church has been able to encourage people by praying and bringing food. They also help with funerals of people who have died from the virus and give comfort to the grieving families and community.

She loves her job as teacher but the school is closed because of the COVID-19 virus. At home, Anita has listened to radio programs and has learned a lot about the virus and how to keep it from spreading. With all that she has learned Anita helps to teach her community how to keep themselves safe from the virus.  Even though going out and talking with lots of people increases her risk of getting the virus, she knows that it’s important for everyone to know how to prevent the virus from spreading. She teaches her neighbors, “We must be careful to wash our hands often"". Then she explains, “We need to wear masks when we  leave our homes or when we are with people who do not live in the same house as us"". ""We also must try to avoid spending lots of time with people outside of our own household"". ""Also, we need to keep two meters away from other people when we shop, work or talk to neighbors"". ""Doing these things will help to stop the virus from spreading from person to person”.  One day, Anita doesn’t feel well. She has a bad headache, a fever, and has begun to cough. Also, she notices that she cannot taste or smell her food. Anita realizes that she has Covid-19.  Right away she tells her family and says, “We all need to stay home and keep away from others. You might have the virus, too, even though you do not feel sick. You could easily spread the virus to others.” Then Anita goes and stays alone in a separate room, away from the family. She does not want to give them the sickness. Anita’s husband, David, takes care of her. He brings her food and takes away the empty dishes. He keeps her dishes separate and only Anita uses them. David always wears a mask whenever he goes into her room. He also washes his hands every time he does anything for her. Anita also wears a mask when he comes into the room. The family shares one bathroom. So whenever Anita uses it, she always wears a mask.  When she is done, she wipes down the bathroom with a disinfectant solution before going back to her room. After a couple of days, Marcos, Anita’s 8 year old son, starts feeling bad too. Then her mother, who lives with them, develops a fever. They both move into the same room with Anita to try to keep the rest of the family safe.  Anita’s husband continues to be the only one in the family who brings food and cares for the three sick family members.  The room where Anita, her mother, and Marcos stay is small and crowded.

He is careful to wear a mask as well. The Community Health Worker, Maria, has taught David how to care for his sick family. He knows to give them fever medicine when they need it.  When they cannot eat much, he feeds them simple hot broth and soup. His daughters help by cooking the broth. His mother-in-law, Flora, gets so ill that she cannot eat anything. So, David  mixes 8 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a liter of clean water for Flora to drink. He tries to make sure that they all drink two liters of liquid per day. After several days of being very sick, Anita begins to feel better. Her son, Marcos, does not get very sick and recovers very quickly. Flora, Anita’s mother, starts to feel better for a couple of days, too, but then she gets sicker again. Her fever goes up and she begins to have difficulty breathing.  Anita is scared for her mother. She says to David, “We need to take Mama to the Doctor!”  David replies, “I wish we could. But because of the lockdown there are no buses running. Even Maria, our Community Health Worker, can’t come!"" Thankfully, Anita is able to call Maria on the phone to get some advice about how to take care of her mother. Maria tells her, “Remember that all of you still need to quarantine from the rest of the community to keep from spreading the disease. There are ways you can help your mother even if you cannot go out.” She says to Anita, “You can now care for your mother since you have already had Covid-19 and it is unlikely that you will get it again right away. Also, Flora’s room needs to be well-ventilated and she needs to keep drinking liquids"". Maria is glad to hear that the room has a door to the outside, which can be opened to let air inside.  David opens the door and puts a screen curtain up so that the air can come in but the flies stay outside. When the door is shut, David makes sure the window is open because the fresh air helps Flora to breathe more easily.  Anita helps her mother take sips of water at least every hour. Anita learns from Maria to have her mother take some deep, slow breaths every hour. This helps Flora keep her lungs working properly. Anita also helps Flora change her position often. She tries to have Flora lie on her stomach whenever she can because that also helps Flora’s lungs. Maria also teaches Anita another way to help Flora’s lungs, by making a bubble bottle. First Anita fills a coke bottle with about 5 centimeters of water and puts a straw into the bottle. Then Flora blows gently into the straw to make the water bubble. Doing this several times every couple of hours helps her lungs work better. Anita is thankful for all of Maria's advice. Flora slowly begins to feel better and gets her strength back. The family keeps track of the days since Anita, Marco and Flora first got sick. Finally, after 14 days, they check their temperatures. None of them have had a fever for at least 24 hours, and they are able to go out of the house again.They will not spread the sickness anymore. Anita hopes she can see Maria, the Community Health Worker, again soon. She wants to thank her for all she’s taught Anita and the rest of the community. David and Anita are glad to know that they took care of their family in the best possible ways even though they could not go and get medical help in person.  Many others in their community have Covid-19. Anita and David have learned so much that now they can help them and their families. Their church has been able to encourage people by praying and bringing food. They also help with funerals of people who have died from the virus and give comfort to the grieving families and community. Everyone is looking forward to when they can get the vaccine to protect against Covid-19. Thankfully, while they wait, they know what to do.  "
