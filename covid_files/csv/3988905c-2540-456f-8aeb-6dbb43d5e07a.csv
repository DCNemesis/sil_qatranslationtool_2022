Anita and her family live in a small town. She loves her job as teacher but the school is closed because of the COVID-19 virus.
"At home, Anita has listened to radio programs and has learned a lot about the virus and how to keep it from spreading."
With all that she has learned Anita helps to teach her community how to keep themselves safe from the virus.
" Even though going out and talking with lots of people increases her risk of getting the virus, she knows that it’s important for everyone to know how to prevent the virus from spreading. She teaches her neighbors, “We must be careful to wash our hands often""."
"Then she explains, “We need to wear masks when we  leave our homes or when we are with people who do not live in the same house as us""."
"""We also must try to avoid spending lots of time with people outside of our own household""."
"""Also, we need to keep two meters away from other people when we shop, work or talk to neighbors""."
"""Doing these things will help to stop the virus from spreading from person to person”."
"One day, Anita doesn’t feel well. She has a bad headache, a fever, and has begun to cough. Also, she notices that she cannot taste or smell her food. Anita realizes that she has Covid-19. "
"Right away she tells her family and says, “We all need to stay home and keep away from others. You might have the virus, too, even though you do not feel sick. You could easily spread the virus to others.”"
"Then Anita goes and stays alone in a separate room, away from the family. She does not want to give them the sickness."
"Anita’s husband, David, takes care of her. He brings her food and takes away the empty dishes. He keeps her dishes separate and only Anita uses them."
David always wears a mask whenever he goes into her room. He also washes his hands every time he does anything for her. Anita also wears a mask when he comes into the room.
"The family shares one bathroom. So whenever Anita uses it, she always wears a mask. "
"When she is done, she wipes down the bathroom with a disinfectant solution before going back to her room."
"After a couple of days, Marcos, Anita’s 8 year old son, starts feeling bad too. Then her mother, who lives with them, develops a fever. They both move into the same room with Anita to try to keep the rest of the family safe.  Anita’s husband continues to be the only one in the family who brings food and cares for the three sick family members.  The room where Anita, her mother, and Marcos stay is small and crowded."
"Happily, it has a door to the outside. David sets up a place outside the door where the three sick family members can rest and enjoy the fresh air."
Anita and David’s daughters cook and do the laundry to help out.
 Some neighbors bring groceries and fever medicines so that the family does not spread the disease by going to the shops themselves. They understand that even people who do not feel sick might have the virus and can spread the illness. They know it is important that Anita and David's whole family stays at home.
"David says to the neighbors, “Do not come close to our sick family members! We do not want you to get sick, too. But please do pray for them, sing songs and visit with them from outside the enclosure.”"
"The pastor comes every couple of days to pray for the sick, and encourage them by reading the Scriptures aloud from across the fence. He is careful to wear a mask as well."
"The Community Health Worker, Maria, has taught David how to care for his sick family. He knows to give them fever medicine when they need it.  When they cannot eat much, he feeds them simple hot broth and soup. His daughters help by cooking the broth."
"His mother-in-law, Flora, gets so ill that she cannot eat anything."
"So, David  mixes 8 teaspoons of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a liter of clean water for Flora to drink. He tries to make sure that they all drink two liters of liquid per day."
"After several days of being very sick, Anita begins to feel better. Her son, Marcos, does not get very sick and recovers very quickly."
"Flora, Anita’s mother, starts to feel better for a couple of days, too, but then she gets sicker again. Her fever goes up and she begins to have difficulty breathing.  Anita is scared for her mother. She says to David, “We need to take Mama to the Doctor!”  David replies, “I wish we could. But because of the lockdown there are no buses running. Even Maria, our Community Health Worker, can’t come!"""
"Thankfully, Anita is able to call Maria on the phone to get some advice about how to take care of her mother."
"Maria tells her, “Remember that all of you still need to quarantine from the rest of the community to keep from spreading the disease. There are ways you can help your mother even if you cannot go out.”"
"She says to Anita, “You can now care for your mother since you have already had Covid-19 and it is unlikely that you will get it again right away. Also, Flora’s room needs to be well-ventilated and she needs to keep drinking liquids"". Maria is glad to hear that the room has a door to the outside, which can be opened to let air inside.  David opens the door and puts a screen curtain up so that the air can come in but the flies stay outside. When the door is shut, David makes sure the window is open because the fresh air helps Flora to breathe more easily. "
Anita helps her mother take sips of water at least every hour.
"Anita learns from Maria to have her mother take some deep, slow breaths every hour. This helps Flora keep her lungs working properly."
Anita also helps Flora change her position often. She tries to have Flora lie on her stomach whenever she can because that also helps Flora’s lungs.
"Maria also teaches Anita another way to help Flora’s lungs, by making a bubble bottle."
First Anita fills a coke bottle with about 5 centimeters of water and puts a straw into the bottle.
Then Flora blows gently into the straw to make the water bubble. Doing this several times every couple of hours helps her lungs work better.
Anita is thankful for all of Maria's advice. Flora slowly begins to feel better and gets her strength back.
"The family keeps track of the days since Anita, Marco and Flora first got sick. Finally, after 14 days, they check their temperatures. None of them have had a fever for at least 24 hours, and they are able to go out of the house again.They will not spread the sickness anymore."
"Anita hopes she can see Maria, the Community Health Worker, again soon. She wants to thank her for all she’s taught Anita and the rest of the community. David and Anita are glad to know that they took care of their family in the best possible ways even though they could not go and get medical help in person.  Many others in their community have Covid-19. Anita and David have learned so much that now they can help them and their families."
Their church has been able to encourage people by praying and bringing food. They also help with funerals of people who have died from the virus and give comfort to the grieving families and community.
"Everyone is looking forward to when they can get the vaccine to protect against Covid-19. Thankfully, while they wait, they know what to do."
