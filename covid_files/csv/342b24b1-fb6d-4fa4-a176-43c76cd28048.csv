The training is designed for church leaders and lay volunteers, particularly those in contexts where medical resources are limited, medical PPE is unavailable and resources are in short supply. The four-part training aims to equip churches to participate in a gospel-based response to the physical, emotional and spiritual impacts of COVID-19 in communities.  SIM healthcare professionals have reviewed and approved the contents of this version for accuracy.

5,Anyone who is visiting or caring for a COVID-19 patient at home will need Personal Protective Equipment or PPE. PPE can be made from common materials found in your home or at the market. You don't need a fancy white or yellow suit unless you are in the same room as someone on a special breathing machine.
6,Someone is standing and facing the camera wearing a professional PPE suit complete with respirator. There is a circle around them with a slash through it.
7,"To protect yourself adequately, you will need: · Hat or Shower Cap · Face Shield or Mask and Glasses · Gown that covers your torso, arms, and legs · Gloves · Boots (only if you are working with urine or feces)"
8,"Two hands are stapling foam, elastic and plastic film together to make a face shield."

10,"There are many ways to fashion PPE out of common everyday objects. In the picture above, someone is creating a face shield out of plastic film, foam, elastic, and a stapler.  Let's meet some individuals who have created their own PPE out of common household objects."
11,"Benaya is standing in his homemade PPE - a rainjacket, cleaning gloves, and a face shield."
13,"Hi, my name is Benaya. I'm wearing gloves, a raincoat, a cap, and a face shield. I made this [face shield] out of foam, plastic sheeting, and elastic and stapled it all together."
14,"Merri is wearing her homemade PPE: a choir robe, cleaning gloves, and a hard hat with plastic film glued on to the front. She is pointing to her sleeves that she's tied closed with string."
15,"My name is Merri. I am wearing a choir robe from my church. As you can see, I tied my sleeves in with string from the market. I'm also wearing cleaning gloves from the market, and on my head I have face protection made from a hard hat with some plastic from the market glued on."

18,"Maria is wearing her homemade PPE consisting of: a shower cap, cleaning gloves, a long-sleeved shirt put on backwards, and a garbage bag that she's tied in the back to cover her torso."

22,"Dave is wearing his homemade PPE. It includes a long-sleeved shirt that he is wearing backwards. He has sewn extra cloth at the bottom of the shirt to provide more protection. He is also wearing cleaning gloves, and a cap with plastic stapled to the brim."
23,"Hi there, my name is Dave, and I'm wearing a men's shirt that I'm wearing backwards and I've sewn an extra piece of cloth to make it longer. I'm wearing cleaning gloves and I've also fashioned a face shield out of a piece of plastic stapled to an old baseball cap."
24,"A few cleaning materials are assembled including a spray bottle, sponges, and gloves."
25,"You can make a simple bleach solution by mixing 4 teaspoons of full-strength bleach and 1 liter of water. Pour the solution into a spray bottle or a sprayer to use. The resulting bleach solution should smell strongly of bleach. Be sure to use bleach that has not been diluted by the merchant. Also, diluted bleach solutions are only effective for one week. Make a fresh solution if it is older than one week. If you have another disinfectant, like Dettol, you can use that instead. "
26,People wearing PPE are lined up with hands outstretched to receive a spray of bleach solution to their gloves.
27,"It is important that you properly remove your PPE after visiting someone who is sick with or potentially sick with COVID-19. Otherwise you could accidentally infect yourself. Here's the proper procedure for safely removing your PPE. You need at least two people for this process. Before you begin, set out plastic bags or buckets by each person to collect the PPE."
28,A man is removing his bandana mask by pulling it away from himself and over his head. He is wearing gloves.
29,"First the workers will have their gloves sprayed with a bleach solution. They rub the bleach solution all over their gloves. Then they all take off their eye protection and have their hands sprayed again. They then take off their hats and get their hands sprayed again. Then they take off their masks if they wore them, grab them by the front, and pull them off and drop them into the plastic bag. They then have their hands sprayed again. Next they take off their gowns and get their hands sprayed again. Notice that they are very careful not to touch their clothing or skin. If they have something to untie, a fellow worker with gloves that have been sprayed unties the gown for them. They roll the gown up carefully and drop it into the plastic bag."
30,A man is spraying down the outside of a plastic bag with a sprayer filled with bleach solution.
31,"They then have their gloves sprayed again. They then take off their gloves. They pull off the first glove by grabbing it from the outside with the other glove. They use their bare hand to take off their remaining glove by putting their bare finger under the end of the remaining glove and pulling it off. Both gloves are dropped into the plastic bag. Lastly, the workers wash their hands with soap and water. Touching only the outside of the plastic bag the workers should then close the bags and spray the outside of the bags with bleach solution. The bags are then taken home and dumped into a bucket where there is some bleach solution. The contents are soaked in the bleach solution for 15 minutes. They then can be taken out and washed and hung to dry. All of this PPE can be reused. "
