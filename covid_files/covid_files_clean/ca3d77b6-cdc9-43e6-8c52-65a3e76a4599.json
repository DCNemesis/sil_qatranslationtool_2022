As time went on, he heard that more and more people were dying of this disease called Covid. But it didn't seem to be affecting life in his town. Amani and his wife Rose had a son, Mark, who was studying in the capital city. One night as they chatted with Mark, he told them that people were dying there in the capital of Covid, but the Government hadn\u2019t yet issued a public statement.\n\nAfter a couple months more, no-one could deny that Covid was in the country. People were dying in the big cities and the hospitals were becoming overwhelmed. Oxygen, which was needed by the sickest patients, was in short supply. Amani learned a lot about the disease and helped his church people to learn to do the things that would stop the disease spreading, like washing their hands frequently, wearing a mask outside the house, and not getting too close to people. They also learned how to know someone had caught Covid, and to keep away from crowds. Amani worked hard with the other churches in the area, particularly the large Catholic church in town, which was just down the road. They helped people who had to stay home get food.\n"
